 # this script checks every 5 min if available local memory is lower
 # than 500 MB and if yes – will delete user's cache :)
 #
 # how to use: 
 # 1) you can run this in bg, which is not comfy;
 # 2) cron, baby, cron;
 # 3) howewer, I haven't found a way to run this on boot: cron needs root,
 # ../LaunchDaemons also need root to load config file ;(
 # 
 # without sudo life is sad..
